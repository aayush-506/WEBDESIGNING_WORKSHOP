    <h3style="color: black>  CSS</h3>
    <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).
        CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media. </p>

<h3>style="color: black;"JS</h3>

<p>JavaScript was born in 1995, and it is a programming language similar to other languages, but it runs faster because it doesn't have many predefined functions. JavaScript can create programs, libraries, and scripts for websites or desktop applications.
    A lot of web developers are also good at writing JavaScript </p>
